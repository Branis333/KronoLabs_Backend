ðŸŽ¬ VIDEO BACKEND SYSTEM - COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION

I've successfully created a comprehensive video backend system for your application, 
similar to YouTube but integrated with your existing social media platform.

ðŸ“‹ WHAT WAS CREATED:

1. DATABASE MODELS (models/social_models.py):
   âœ… Video - Main video table with binary thumbnail + Google Drive URL
   âœ… VideoLike - Like system for videos
   âœ… VideoComment - Comment system with threading
   âœ… SavedVideo - User watchlist/favorites

2. API SCHEMAS (schemas/social_schemas.py):
   âœ… VideoCreate, VideoResponse - Request/response models
   âœ… VideoCommentCreate, VideoCommentResponse - Comment models
   âœ… VideoUpdateInfo - Update video information
   âœ… VideosResponse - Paginated video listings

3. GOOGLE DRIVE INTEGRATION (utils/google_drive_utils.py):
   âœ… GoogleDriveUtils class for video upload/management
   âœ… Video validation and processing
   âœ… Automatic thumbnail generation from video
   âœ… Public shareable URL generation
   âœ… File deletion and management

4. MEDIA PROCESSING (utils/media_utils.py - EXTENDED):
   âœ… Video thumbnail processing
   âœ… Video file validation
   âœ… Size and format checking

5. COMPLETE API ENDPOINTS (Endpoints/videos.py):
   âœ… POST /videos/ - Upload video with thumbnail
   âœ… GET /videos/ - Browse videos with filtering
   âœ… GET /videos/{id} - Get video details + increment views
   âœ… POST /videos/{id}/like - Like/unlike videos
   âœ… POST /videos/{id}/save - Save to watchlist
   âœ… POST /videos/{id}/comments - Add comments
   âœ… GET /videos/{id}/comments - Get comments
   âœ… PATCH /videos/{id} - Update video info
   âœ… DELETE /videos/{id} - Delete video
   âœ… GET /videos/media/thumbnail/{id} - Serve thumbnails

6. SYSTEM INTEGRATION:
   âœ… Added to main.py router
   âœ… Updated user model relationships
   âœ… Migration script for database tables
   âœ… Comprehensive setup guide
   âœ… Requirements file for dependencies

ðŸŽ¯ KEY FEATURES:

UPLOAD & STORAGE:
- Videos stored on Google Drive (your specified folder)
- Thumbnails stored as binary data in database
- Support for MP4, AVI, MOV, WebM, and other formats
- Automatic file validation and processing
- Up to 500MB per video

YOUTUBE-LIKE FUNCTIONALITY:
- Browse videos with pagination
- Search by title, description, tags
- Filter by category, user, etc.
- View count tracking
- Like/unlike system
- Save to watchlist (favorites)
- Comment system with replies
- Creator controls (edit/delete own videos)

SOCIAL FEATURES:
- Integration with existing user system
- Privacy controls (public/private)
- Category and tag support
- User profiles with video counts
- Full social interaction (likes, comments, saves)

ðŸ”§ SETUP PROCESS:

1. INSTALL DEPENDENCIES:
   pip install -r requirements_video.txt

2. SET UP GOOGLE DRIVE:
   - Follow VIDEO_SETUP_GUIDE.md for detailed instructions
   - Create Google Cloud Project
   - Enable Google Drive API
   - Create service account and download credentials
   - Share your Drive folder with service account

3. RUN DATABASE MIGRATION:
   python migrate_videos.py

4. START SERVER:
   uvicorn main:app --reload

ðŸš€ HOW IT WORKS:

UPLOAD FLOW:
User uploads video file + thumbnail â†’ System validates files â†’ Thumbnail processed and stored in DB as binary â†’ Video uploaded to Google Drive â†’ Google Drive returns public URL â†’ Video record created with thumbnail (binary) + video URL â†’ Users can stream directly from Google Drive

VIEWING FLOW:
User requests video list â†’ System returns videos with base64 thumbnails â†’ User clicks video â†’ View count incremented â†’ Video streams from Google Drive URL â†’ Comments/likes work like social media posts

ðŸŽ¬ API USAGE EXAMPLES:

CREATE VIDEO:
POST /videos/
- video_file: MP4/AVI/MOV file
- thumbnail: JPG/PNG image  
- title: "My Video Title"
- description: "Video description"
- category: "Entertainment"
- tags: ["funny", "tutorial"]

BROWSE VIDEOS:
GET /videos/?category=Entertainment&search=tutorial&limit=20

INTERACT:
POST /videos/{id}/like     # Like video
POST /videos/{id}/save     # Save to watchlist
POST /videos/{id}/comments # Add comment

ðŸ”’ SECURITY & PERMISSIONS:

- Only authenticated users can upload videos
- Only video creators can edit/delete their videos
- Google Drive files are publicly readable but not writable
- Service account has limited permissions to your specific folder
- Binary thumbnails stored securely in database
- Full input validation and file size limits

ðŸ“Š DATABASE STRUCTURE:

videos table:
- id, user_id, title, description
- thumbnail_data (BYTEA), thumbnail_mime_type
- video_url (Google Drive), video_filename
- duration, category, tags (JSON)
- is_public, view_count, timestamps

Supporting tables:
- video_likes (user_id, video_id)
- video_comments (video_id, user_id, text, parent_id)
- saved_videos (user_id, video_id)

âœ¨ INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING SYSTEM:

Your video system seamlessly integrates with:
- Existing user authentication
- Social media features (likes, comments)
- Binary storage system (for thumbnails)
- FastAPI architecture
- PostgreSQL database

ðŸŽ‰ RESULT:

You now have a complete YouTube-like video platform that:
- Stores videos on Google Drive (as requested)
- Keeps thumbnails in database as binary (like your other media)
- Provides full social features
- Scales with your existing architecture
- Follows the same patterns as your posts/comics systems

The system is production-ready and follows best practices for:
- File upload handling
- Database design
- API structure
- Security
- Performance (with proper indexing)

Ready to upload your first video! ðŸš€
